# TrinaPy
Write a task-oriented while still being conversational chatbot in python code designed to complete specific tasks (e.g. answering questions, activating the software installed on this computer and keeping track of appointments and reminders), while still having a conversational flow, allowing for more open-ended interactions. The chatbot should have a friendly and approachable tone and personality, but be professional and straightforward depending on the topic. It should be able to understand the difference between a serious question and a joke, and respond appropriately.

The chatbot's knowledge base will be limited by the bot being on local computers and the size limitations of the hard drive, but it still needs to be able to connect to the internet and read information from web pages when available. The chatbot needs to be able to remember all past conversations with the operator and continue them when offline. Memories will have to be stored on the local machine, and the chatbot should be able to think and understand. The knowledge base will have access to a pre-determined basic set of information and will be able to learn and improve over time from reading text files and online conversations.
